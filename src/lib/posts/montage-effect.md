excerpt: How our understanding of effort in training is affected by videos/movies
---

There’s a fair amount of influence that movies and media play in our lives. Watching an action movie where the protagonist beats up an army of goons with their fists might lead to a warped sense of how we’d be in a similar fight. Or analyzing certain devious ploys in Game of Thrones of [Race 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375789/) might make us look at inter personal interactions in a different light. And then there’s a whole ginormous body of work on the effects reels and Tiktoks make in moulding our perception.

One such phenomenon I’ve noticed is how our idea of time gets warped while watching transformations in media. For the sake of simplicity I’ll only stick with physical transformations here, although the idea could also be extrapolated to other characteristics such as personalities or character ties.

When it comes to movies, usually action or sports films, there’s often a montage where the protagonist goes through grueling [training sessions](https://collider.com/best-training-montages-in-movies/) (_think: Rocky or Kung Fu Panda_). This is usually the point where the character transforms from a beginner/intermediate to the master warrior level as a signal on being ready for the “_final challenge_”. The montage generally follows a rough guideline of either being just a collation of training routines or a progression such as:

- Fail miserably
- Fall into the chasm of self doubt
- The breakthrough moment
- The immediate mastery (usually flying in the face of the 10,000 hour “rule”)

A similar derivation of this is with influencers putting up a transformation montage usually embellished with music starting with sad piano notes swelling up to a war drum ensemble or hard rock riffs as the _**after**_ shots are revealed.

The idea of what a montage aims to convey can be condensed to a _motivation→effort→result_ chain. Since a strong motivation is what leads to prolonged effort ending up with a dramatic result. The variables in this chain is the intensity of the **motivation**, the length of the **effort** and the degree of change the **result** brings in.

The human brain is already notorious with estimating effort. That’s why most of our projects start off with the most optimistic timelines often getting derailed and end in a [Mexican standoff](https://tenor.com/xPzR.gif) with our blame guns aimed at potential suspects.

Bear in mind that our media consuming brains are now bombarded with montages that rely heavily on the **motivation** and **result** part of that chain. The **effort** aspect is condensed down to a few edits, cause the length of the effort itself is the most boring yet effective part of the process. This is in direct correlation with why training for something takes disciplined consistency which happen to be close cousins to ennui and boredom.

How this has primed us is by getting us enamored with the _motivation_ and the _result_, making us pay less heed to the _effort_. Since _effort_ is at times seen as an outcome of _motivation_.

New media has thus introduced the ability to see motivation and result in one go, making our primordial brains conflate this to **motivation = result**.

And that’s why I blame new media for obliterating my understanding of training leading to me currently wolfing down copious junk food I’ve now ordered. Thanks for nothing technology!
